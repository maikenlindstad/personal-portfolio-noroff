      <p>I'm a junior frontend developer with a passion
      for making creative webpages and use a lot
      of fiction and fantasy to come up with my 
      designs. </p></div>

    <div class="aboutMeSection">
    <p>
      I have always been an explorer and could never pinpoint the one thing to do with
      my life. To be honest, I wanted to do it all. As a child I played piano, tuba, trumpet and guitar.
      I danced jazz, ballet, breakdancing and hiphop. If I found an item, I tried it out and learned the history
      behind it. 
      And when I got older I found interior design, fashion, drawing, painting, sculpting,
      marketing, economics ++.  I wanted to visit the entire world and try everything in it. I learned a lot, 
      and I have been keeping it up.
      </p><p>
      I ended up working in healthcare, but never found the mental stimulation that I needed. 
      It became difficult to figure out what I wanted out of life, but after a lot of motivational 
      speeches I found the courage to quit my job, go out there and find my path. My 
      philosophy became to find my passion and make a living out of it, rather than start 
      making a living and try to find my passion.
      <span></span>
      After getting into college I started noticing that I liked the courses that was 
      centered around information technology and after building my first webpage, I knew. 
      <br> <br>
      I was going to be a frontend developer.
      </p><p>
      <span></span>Fast forward a few years and here we are. I graduated out of Noroff School of Technology
      and Digital Media in December 2022. Eagerly anticipating a career with a lot of variety, I placed 
      my focus on school and was gifted the opportunity to work hard on making my personal life simple 
      to make room for what's to come.

      </p><p>
      Besides thriving with front end codes I'm also captivated by digital fashion, AI, VR and 
      the meta universe. I love Halloween and in 2021 I started <a href="https://svartsalt.no/" target="_blank">my 
      own e-commerce</a> selling witch- and Halloween items for other
      Norwegian enthusiasts. Every other Thursday since the summer of 2022 I have been vlogging for a known Norwegian
      witch coven, <a href="https://covenlunatic.com/" target="_blank">Coven Lunatic</a>, and I play chess at my local
      club. Finally, when I need to take a breather I usually <a href="#spookyMagazine">write</a> or meditate, or one might find me
      streaming on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/memaiken" target="_blank">Twitch</a>... But I also love sitcoms.</p><p>
      I always dream big and hope that I will find a place with dreams as big as mine, and that 
      my chosen path can lead me to places I have never been before.
